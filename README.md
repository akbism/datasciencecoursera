GETTING AND CLEANING DATA COURSE PROJECT

===========================================

This excercise has been carried out with the data provided to us for the fulfillment of the course Getting and Cleaning Data.
Data Source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The original data has been collected with the help of human activity recognition using Smartphones. The complete information 
regarding the experiment has been provided in the README.txt file in the downloaded folder using above link. 

We are required to make the original data ready for data analysis by using tidying techniques learnt in the R Programming 
courses. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure : variables are stored in 
columns, observations in rows, and a single type of experimental unit per dataset. Each column of the tidy dataset should 
have a column name.
To make the data concise, one can also keep only average value of variables for the combination of key parameters. 

All steps performed by me for tidying the original data set have been explained in the CodeBook.md file.

As per the instruction, I have only kept mean and standard deviation variables for each measurement. 



 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
